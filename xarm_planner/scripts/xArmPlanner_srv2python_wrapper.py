"""
Python wrapper for ROS service client functions. 
This can requesting cartesian plans, joint plans, and execution of planned motions for a robotic arm controlled by the "xarm_planner" node.

Functions:
- request_srv_cartesian_plan(x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz): Requests a cartesian plan for a robotic arm's end effector to move to a desired position and orientation in 3D space by communicating with the "xarm_straight_plan" ROS service.
- request_srv_joint_plan(input_joints): Requests a joint plan for a robotic arm's end effector to move to a desired configuration in joint space by communicating with the "xarm_joint_plan" ROS service.
- request_srv_execute_plan(request_boolean): Requests the execution of a previously planned motion by communicating with the "xarm_exec_plan" ROS service.
